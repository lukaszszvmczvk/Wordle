# Wordle

The program implements the well-known Wordle game using WinApi. However, there are 3 levels of difficulty:
Level 1 - one window, 6 attempts,
Level 2 - two windows, 8 attempts,
Level 3 - four windows, 10 attempts.

The difficulty level selected when closing the application is remembered and will be automatically selected the next time the program is launched. 
An interesting addition is also the on-screen keyboard, with buttons that change color depending on whether the entered letter is correct in the specific game window.
